## Introduction

This repository contains a reference implementation of Decentralized Web Node (DWN) as per the [specification](https://identity.foundation/decentralized-web-node/spec/). This specification is in a draft state and very much so a WIP. For the foreseeable future, a lot of the work on DWN will be split across this repo and the repo that houses the specification, which you can find [here](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/decentralized-web-node). The current implementation does not include all interfaces described in the DWN spec, but is enough to begin building test applications.

This project is used as a dependency by several other projects.

Proposals and issues for the specification itself should be submitted as pull requests to the [spec repo](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/decentralized-web-node).

## Running online environment

Interested in contributing instantly? You can make your updates directly without cloning in the running CodeSandbox environment.

[![Edit in CodeSandbox](https://assets.codesandbox.io/github/button-edit-lime.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/TBD54566975/dwn-sdk-js/main)

## Installation

If you are interested in using DWNs and web5 in your web app, you probably want to look at web5-js, instead of this repository. Head on over here: https://github.com/TBD54566975/web5-js.

For advanced users wishing to use this repo directly:

```bash
npm install @tbd54566975/dwn-sdk-js
```

## Additional Steps

This package has dependency on [`@noble/ed25519`](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-ed25519#usage) and [`@noble/secp256k1`](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-secp256k1#usage) v2, additional steps are needed for some environments:

### Node.js <= 18

```js
// node.js 18 and earlier,  needs globalThis.crypto polyfill
import { webcrypto } from "node:crypto";
// @ts-ignore
if (!globalThis.crypto) globalThis.crypto = webcrypto;
```

### React Native
Usage of DWN SDK in react native requires a bit of set up at the moment. To simplify, we've published an npm package that can be used to set everything up which you can find [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tbd54566975/web5-react-native-polyfills). Follow the instructions there to get everything set up.

### Usage in Browser:

`dwn-sdk-js` requires 2 polyfills: `crypto` and `stream`. we recommend using `crypto-browserify` and `stream-browserify`. Both of these polyfills can be installed using npm. e.g. `npm install --save crypto-browserify stream-browserify`

#### Vanilla HTML / JS

DWN SDK includes a polyfilled distribution that can imported in a `module` script tag. e.g.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>
  <script type="module">
    import { Dwn, DataStream, DidKeyResolver, Jws, RecordsWrite } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tbd54566975/dwn-sdk-js@0.1.1/dist/bundles/dwn.js'
    import { MessageStoreLevel, DataStoreLevel, EventLogLevel } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tbd54566975/dwn-sdk-js@0.1.1/dist/bundles/level-stores.js'

    const messageStore = new MessageStoreLevel();
    const dataStore = new DataStoreLevel();
    const eventLog = new EventLogLevel();
    const dwn = await Dwn.create({ messageStore, dataStore, eventLog });

    // generate a did:key DID
    const didKey = await DidKeyResolver.generate();

    // create some data
    const encoder = new TextEncoder();
    const data = encoder.encode('Hello, World!');

    // create a RecordsWrite message
    const recordsWrite = await RecordsWrite.create({
      data,
      dataFormat: 'application/json',
      published: true,
      schema: 'yeeter/post',
      authorizationSigner: Jws.createSigner(didKey)
    });

    // get the DWN to process the RecordsWrite
    const dataStream = DataStream.fromBytes(data);
    const result = await dwn.processMessage(didKey.did, recordsWrite.message, dataStream);

    console.log(result.status);
    console.assert(result.status.code === 202)

    await dwn.close()

  </script>
</body>

</html>
```

#### Webpack >= 5

add the following to the top level of your webpack config (`webpack.config.js`)

```js
resolve: {
  fallback: {
    stream: require.resolve("stream-browserify"),
    crypto: require.resolve("crypto-browserify")
  }
}
```

#### Vite
add the following to the top level of your vite config (`vite.config.js`)

```js
define: {
  global: 'globalThis'
},
resolve: {
  alias: {
    'crypto': 'crypto-browserify',
    'stream': 'stream-browserify'
  }
}
```

#### esbuild
we recommend using `node-stdlib-browser` instead of `crypto-browserify` and `stream-browserify` individually. Example usage:

```js
import esbuild from 'esbuild'
import stdLibBrowser from 'node-stdlib-browser'
import polyfillProviderPlugin from 'node-stdlib-browser/helpers/esbuild/plugin'

import { createRequire } from 'node:module';

const require = createRequire(import.meta.url);

esbuild.build({
  entryPoints: ['dwn-sdk-test.js'],
  platform: 'browser',
  bundle: true,
  format: 'esm',
  outfile: 'dist/dwn-sdk-test.js',
  inject      : [require.resolve('node-stdlib-browser/helpers/esbuild/shim')],
  plugins     : [polyfillProviderPlugin(stdLibBrowser)],
  define      : {
    'global': 'globalThis'
  }
})
```

## Usage

[API docs](https://tbd54566975.github.io/dwn-sdk-js/)

```ts

import { Dwn, DataStream, DidKeyResolver, Jws, RecordsWrite } from '@tbd54566975/dwn-sdk-js';
import { DataStoreLevel, EventLogLevel, MessageStoreLevel } from '@tbd54566975/dwn-sdk-js/stores';

const messageStore = new MessageStoreLevel();
const dataStore = new DataStoreLevel();
const eventLog = new EventLogLevel();
const dwn = await Dwn.create({ messageStore, dataStore, eventLog });

// generate a did:key DID
const didKey = await DidKeyResolver.generate();

// create some data
const encoder = new TextEncoder();
const data = encoder.encode('Hello, World!');

// create a RecordsWrite message
const recordsWrite = await RecordsWrite.create({
  data,
  dataFormat: 'application/json',
  published: true,
  schema: 'yeeter/post',
  authorizationSigner: Jws.createSigner(didKey)
});

// get the DWN to process the RecordsWrite
const dataStream = DataStream.fromBytes(data);
const result = await dwn.processMessage(didKey.did, recordsWrite.message, dataStream);
console.log(result.status);

```

With a web wallet installed:

```javascript
const result = await window.web5.dwn.processMessage({
  method: "RecordsQuery",
  message: {
    filter: {
      schema: "http://some-schema-registry.org/todo",
    },
    dateSort: "createdAscending",
  },
});
```

### Custom Tenant Gating
By default, all DIDs are allowed as tenants. A custom tenant gate implementation can be provided when initializing the DWN.
```ts
import { Dwn, TenantGate, DataStoreLevel, EventLogLevel, MessageStoreLevel } from '@tbd54566975/dwn-sdk-js';

class CustomTenantGate implements TenantGate {
  public async isTenant(did): Promise<void> {
    // Custom implementation
    // returns `true` if the given DID is a tenant of the DWN; `false` otherwise
  }
}

const messageStore = new MessageStoreLevel();
const dataStore = new DataStoreLevel();
const eventLog = new EventLogLevel();
const tenantGate = new CustomTenantGate();
const dwn = await Dwn.create({ messageStore, dataStore, eventLog, tenantGate });
```

### Custom Signature Signer
If you have the private key readily available, it is recommended to use the built-in `PrivateKeySigner`. Otherwise, you can implement a customer signer to interface with external signing service, API, HSM, TPM etc and use it for signing your DWN messages:

```ts
// create a custom signer
class CustomSigner implements Signer {
  public keyId = 'did:example:alice#key1';
  public algorithm = 'EdDSA'; // use valid `alg` value published in https://www.iana.org/assignments/jose/jose.xhtml
  public async sign (content: Uint8Array): Promise<Uint8Array> {
    ... // custom signing logic
  }
}

const authorizationSigner = new CustomSigner();

const options: RecordsWriteOptions = {
  ...
  authorizationSigner
};

const recordsWrite = await RecordsWrite.create(options);
```


## Release/Build Process

The DWN JS SDK releases builds to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tbd54566975/dwn-sdk-js). There are two build types: stable build and unstable build.

### Stable Build

This is triggered manually by:

1.  Increment `version` in `package.json` in [Semantic Versioning (semver)](https://semver.org/) format.
2.  Merge the change into `main` branch
3.  Create a release from GitHub.

An official build with version matching the `package.json` will be published to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tbd54566975/dwn-sdk-js).

### Unstable Build

Every push to the `main` branch will automatically trigger an unstable build to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tbd54566975/dwn-sdk-js) for developers to experiment and test.

The version string contains the date as well as the commit hash of the last change.

An example version string:

`0.0.26-unstable-2023-03-16-36ec2ce`

- `0.0.26` came from `version` in `package.json`
- `2023-03-16` indicates the date of March 16th 2023
- `36ec2ce` is the commit hash of the last change

## Some projects that use this library:

- [Web5 JS SDK](https://github.com/TBD54566975/web5-js)
- [Example CLI](https://github.com/TBD54566975/dwn-cli)
- [Example with a web wallet](https://github.com/TBD54566975/incubating-web5-labs/)
- [Server side aggregator](https://github.com/TBD54566975/dwn-server)
